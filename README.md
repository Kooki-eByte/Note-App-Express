  ## Documentation <a name="documentation"></a>

  ### Description <a name="description"></a>

  - This project is a Note App using node.js and express.js as the backend. This app is a browser-ready note taker that you can have a subject and have content inside for the actual bit of notes. Once you are done making your notes you can save the note and it will appear on the left hand side for you to click back and see your previously written note(s). It has a easy-going interface with a pleasant color scheme to not irritate the eyes. This is all useful thanks to jQuery, express, and the json file to be able to make a dynamic system of writing files and saving them for later use.
